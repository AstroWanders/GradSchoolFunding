As a grad student, there will often be times when one is in search of funding - thus is the life of the academic. This webpage lists funding sources primarily for Astrophysics PhD students like the author.

A STEM grad student should not have to pay for his/her graduate education. Many students are supported by research and/or teaching assistantships. This section lists fellowships, which would take the place of a teaching or research assistantship, as well as sources of supplemental funding.

# [](#header-1)About the author

I wrote this page because I wanted to gather the various funding sources that crossed my path into one place.

As an Astrophysics PhD student, I have my own research to do, so I reserve the right to not respond to questions should you write to me.
